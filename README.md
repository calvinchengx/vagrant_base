# Vagrantfiles for my various base boxes

* Linux
    * Archlinux x86_64

* Windows boxes are derived from modern.ie
* Supported versions:
	* ie11win81
	* ie10win7
	* ie9win7
	* ie8win7
	* ie7vista
* Boxes include cygwin + opens server + vagrant user set-up

TODO
===

* Consolidate from ground-up and encode building of boxes as packer files and update my repository of packer files
* Figure out `winrm` support
* Of lesser priority, to increase support to include:
    * ie11win7
    * ie10win8
    * ie8xp
